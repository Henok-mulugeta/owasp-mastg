[fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) is a tool for iOS and Android developers to automate tasks like dealing with provisioning profiles, and releasing mobile apps. Once set up, it can be used to resign IPA files with your Xcode provisioning profile.

Before executing fastlane:

- Install fastlane via brew (`brew install fastlane`)
- [Obtain a developer provisioning profile and certificate](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/techniques/ios/MASTG-TECH-0079/#getting-a-developer-provisioning-profile-and-certificate)
- Create a directory `fastlane` and create a `Fastfile` file as described in the documentation for [resigning](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/resign/).

Example:

```yaml
lane :resignipa do
  resign(
    ipa: "<PATH-to-IPA/filename.ipa",
    signing_identity: "Apple Development: Foobar (STGXYCETF3)",
    provisioning_profile: "~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles/<FILE-NAME>.mobileprovision",
  )
end
```

Afterwards, execute the `fastlane resignipa` command.

```bash
$ fastlane resignipa

After having this set up once, you only need to change the path in the `Fastfile` for the IPA you want to resign and execute the command again.
